# Recipe-Parser
Running our system

run "python main.py" to run our recipe parser. in "main.py", in the "main()" function, the function "ti_get_link()" will open our text interface to create transformations of a recipe.

Running the autograder

run "python autograder.py text url.txt", where url.txt is a text file containing the url of the AllRecipes recipe you would like to evaluate. If you want to use the autograder instead of the text interface, you will need to comment out the "ti_get_link()" function call in the "main()" function of "main.py". If "ti_get_link()" is not commented out, the text interface will run instead of the autograder.
